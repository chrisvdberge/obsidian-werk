### bepaling impact voor 2024 initiatieven
- SSR
	- elastic core setup ->
		- impact on zero results as well.
		- LLM + vector search to improve relevancy of results: IMPACT **1.24%** absolute
			- this is synonyms mostly?  relevancy = NDCG mostly
			- so term SSR ->
			  term searches without zero results has SSR = 33.5% 
			  12388480 searches
				- 2698166 of these searches have SSR lower than 10%. Bring these searches to 35% and impact is: 35%-10% -> 0.25*2698166 = 674541 additional successes. which would result in overall SSR of 43.46% or an increase of 1.24%
	- zero results. (suggestions + zero results) 20.43% - 11109999
		- vector & LLM searchs IMPACT op SSR: +0.3%
			- item zero results
				- 6301415
				- solve 10% of these = 630142 -> 15%.   -> +0.17% increase of SSR
			- spell suggestions voor term searches:
				- in 2023: 3251944, SSR van 10%. Dit is 6% van alle searches
					- alle searches: 54372973 en SSR 42.22% = 22956269 searches met success.
					- nieuwe SSR: 22086301.  - 40.62%
					- 3251944 *0.45 = 1463374.    17.74
					- 219506 meer success (SSR van 15%)
				- term zero results (brede definitie) = 3721270 / 54372973 = 6.84%
	- external data sources IMPACT 1.16%
			- 7388729 searches for item zero results. 
			  take away 428171 and 659143 = 6301415 'unknown' item searches 11.6%
			- solve 10% of these = 630142.
				- now 11109999-630142 = 10479857 zero results left OR 19.27%
				- increase to 40% SSR
					- 0.4*630142 -> 0.46%.    (nieuwe: 41.08)
	- visibility <> buyability: IMPACT **2%**  absoluut on zero results
			- deadassortment zero results = 428171
			- local assortment zero results = 659143
			  solving this: 11109999-(428171+659143) = 10022685 / 54372973 = 18.43%
