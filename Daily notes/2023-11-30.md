- [[Findability Painpoints Survey]]
	- #issue
		- visibility of items. Roughly 300k items disappeared, mostly XA items. 
		  We see an unusual increase in facets shown and facets used.
		- [[Eric Rongen]]: "Possible explanation, although we would need to double check: Yesterday roughly 300.000 items disappeared from the webshop, a big portion of them XA items, which miss a lot of attributes values. So items were removed from categories which probably didn't have a lot of attribute values filled, the items that remained in the category did have the attribute values filled, which led to the total fill-rate for those attributes to increase over 75%, which led us to activate the facet. However, not sure if we calculate that fill-rate real-time, I could be totally wrong."
		- facet usage spiked during the incident hours. not just technical facets, also brand facets
