	- ### number of searches
		- **more** searches in [[GA4]]; these searches (visits) are not in UA. probably due to tracking blockers
		  this is around **2%** additional searches
		- **less** searches in GA4 due to session length. The snooze timer event wasn't working in UA, so sessions were 2 hour long.
		  this is around **1%** of less searches
		- **less** searches in GA4; missing in GA4. not sure why. 1 example out of the 10 missing searches checked. 9 others were due to session length
		- **result**: ~1% additional searches
