- [ ] add reversed make model usage to `searches_mapped_master
- [ ] add `seasonality score` to indicate how seasonal a search is and for which period. 
	- ie do a ratio per month or some overall score where 0 is not seasonal, every month same number of searches and 1 is highly seasonal; searches only seen in a given period.
