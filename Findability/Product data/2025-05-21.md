- #product_data #[[writing_rules]]
	- Decimal numbers
		- tire specifications: almost always a dot.
		- kabelbinder: almost always a comma
		- other; mixed, but mostly dot. DE stands out for the frequent comma usage, but still its 75% dot versus comma
		-![[Scherm­afbeelding_2025-05-21_om_18.45.50_1747845954490_0.png]]
	- Levels of thousand
		- hardly (no?) any cases where a separator is used. it doesn't occur a lot at all, most are RAL or DIN numbers
	- Metric Dimensions
		- mostly no space. even DK with 1840 versus 3843 searches has nearly twice the number of searches without the space

	-
	- Percent sign
		- not used as a deliberate symbol at all. we see some examples, but most are html encodings (copy pastes probably) or seemingly 'random' usage.
	- Degree Celsius
		- hardly used with the degree symbol. if used, its without space.

	- "Math symbols (+ and -)"
		- this is exactly as the previous/other examples. in all cases the - is connected to the number. not sure why this guideline is here.
	- Degree
		- hardly used, and if so, without space.
	- "Electrical units (Volt, Watt, …)"
		- majority uses no space in all countries

	- Range / Up to
		- need to look at this separately, users hardly use this but there is an opportunity here to better handle this
			- challenge: 20-24, should match with 21 and 22 as well
	- Small ‘x’ in measure
		- no space far more popular
		- ![[Scherm­afbeelding_2025-05-23_om_11.26.23_1747992386186_0.png]]
	- Thread
		- checked M8x25 with precious check already (number x number)
		-
	- Hardness
	- Diameter
	- Fractions
	- Norms
		- this seems to be 50/50 in all countries, elastic should be able to handle both
