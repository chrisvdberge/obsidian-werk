# where do we come from / what do we know
Combination of;
- product data is diverse and inconsistent
- user search behaviour is diverse and (often) inconsistent
 leads to problems/challenges

examples: 
- the letter `L`
	- 5L for oil
	- 12L for couplings
	- L/9 for gloves
	- 3000l for lights
	- ...


- specifications like; `Insert 90° D N20-1"5/16JIC`
	- where does which spec/value start and end? 
		- is it D N20? 
		- is it N20-1? 
		- is it 16JIC? 
		- ...
